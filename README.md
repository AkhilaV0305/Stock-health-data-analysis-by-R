Stock & Health Data Analysis ðŸ“Š
Overview

This project analyzes stock market trends and health survey data using R to uncover patterns, relationships, and actionable insights. It demonstrates multivariate statistical analysis, factor analysis, PCA, MANOVA, and data visualization.

Stock Market Analysis

Goal: Identify hidden factors influencing stock prices.
Methods: Factor Analysis (PC & MLE) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with Varimax rotation.

Key Insights:

Three main factors:

Market leaders with diversified portfolios (e.g., Walmart, Apple).

Companies influenced by consumer spending trends (e.g., Amazon, Pepsi).

International giants in tech, consumer goods, and finance.

PCA revealed Walmart, Apple, Toyota, and Amazon as top influencers.

Impact: Provides insights for portfolio analysis and investment strategies.

Tools: FactoMineR, psych, GPArotation, ggplot2, corrplot.

Health Metrics Analysis
1. By Gender

Goal: Compare Age, Sleep Duration, and Heart Rate between Male and Female participants.
Method: Hotellingâ€™s TÂ² test & multivariate normality checks.

Insights: Significant differences were observed across all metrics.
Impact: Useful for designing gender-specific wellness initiatives.
Tools: MVN, heplots, DescTools.

2. By Occupation

Goal: Compare Age, Sleep Duration, and Heart Rate across Accountant, Doctor, Lawyer groups.
Method: MANOVA with Bonferroni-adjusted confidence intervals.

Insights: Age, Sleep Duration, and Heart Rate vary significantly by occupation.
Impact: Highlights occupation-specific health trends for targeted interventions.
Tools: car, biotools, MVN.
